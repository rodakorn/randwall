* Backgrounds can be changed at any time using the "play" and "shuffle" buttons
* You can select any image you want for your desktop or lockscreen, to be used now or in the next change.
* Available in English or Spanish

Settings

The first time this extension is executed needs to be configured. Click on the camera icon in the status area, then click the "+" button and the settings dialog will be opened. This settings dialog can be accessed through gnome-shell-extension-prefs or via gnome-tweak-tools -> Extensions.

At least one folder with images has to be selected. 

When you have added some folders, if you click on the camera icon in the status area you will see the current backgrounds and the ones that will be used next time. If you want to select some other backgrounds, just click the shuffle icon and new backgrounds will be chosen randomly for the next change. If you don't want to wait, click the play button and the backgrounds will be changed immediately.

You can define what you want to change: desktop only, lockscreen only, desktop and lockscreen using different images or both using the same image.

If you want to use a specific image from your folder(s), just click on the thumbnail you want to change (Desktop or lockscreen, current or next). In this example I'm changing the next lockscreen image to be used.

A dialog will open showing all images found on your configured folder(s). Just click the one you want to use.

You can search an image if you know the filename. In this example I'm searching for all images containing "paris".
